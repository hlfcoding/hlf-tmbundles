# Bundle Deltas

These changesets improve upon existing functionality. I use and improve them myself every
day. 

## HTML Bundle
* ASP-MVC syntax support
* HTML5 snippets

## CSS Bundle
* CSS3 syntax highlighting

## JavaScript Bundle

- More up to date support.
- Accounts for JS boilerplate language.
- Imputes for more highlighted, including better DOM coverage:
  - Assumes your code is 99% functions and that is mostly what you are working in
    and care about.
  - Assumes you are experienced with JS and are looking for a bundle that makes
    it less painful to write all day, in lieu of CoffeeScript.
  - Assumes you follow conventions with naming instances: 
    `date` `my_date` `element` `elem` `el`
  - Assumes you care about at least viewing the DOM api with proper highlighting
- Uses more of TextMate, including updated doc views, symbol list, autocomplete.

## HLFCoding Bundle
* Useful macros for documenting and developing.

## HLFCrafting Bundle
* A bundle I created for writing prose, inspired by screenwriting conventions for dialogue.

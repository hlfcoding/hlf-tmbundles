# Bundle Deltas

These changesets improve upon existing functionality. I use and improve them myself every
day. The changesets on master are for E-TextEditor; and to install, drop them into
`[User]/Application Data/e/Bundles/`. There is the `textmate` branch for TextMate deltas. 
Note that a lot of bundle changesets are for (re)setting triggers.
